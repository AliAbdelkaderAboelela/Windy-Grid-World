# Windy Grid World Reinforcement Learning

This project investigates the application of SARSA and Q-learning algorithms in the context of Windy Grid World. The experiments include two scenarios: one considering standard moves and the other incorporating king moves.

## Problem Description

Windy Grid World is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an agent navigates through a grid, facing wind-induced movement challenges.

### Variations Explored

1. **Standard Moves:**
   - SARSA algorithm applied to Windy Grid World with standard moves.
   - Q-learning algorithm applied to Windy Grid World with standard moves.

2. **King Moves:**
   - SARSA algorithm applied to Windy Grid World with king moves.
   - Q-learning algorithm applied to Windy Grid World with king moves.
